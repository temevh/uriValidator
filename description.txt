Coding assignment, URI validation, OOP python

Thanks to the concrete requirements given for the program, the coding was fairly straightforward. I took my time to really understand the problem,
and read through it multiple times to get a good understanding of whats required and needed.

The first initial implementation I got done fairly quickly, but there were still some bugs and some required functions missing.
One of the most time-consuming parts was probably the regex validation. I am aware of other solutions that dont utilize regex, but for the sake
of using it for the first time in real life, I decided to use it for this assignment. I also took a few extra minutes to add some validity/existence checks 
for the parameters. 

In the spirit of OOP I decided to use getters (get_path and get_params), which gave a sufficient result in my opinion. As for the language, I decided to use
Python, since it is the language I am most "fluent" with.

For improvements, one that comes to mind is getting rid of imported libraries. Im sure the functionalities offered by the used libraries (re and urllib) could
be achieved without them, but for the sake of saving time and learning a bit about a new libary (urllib) I decided to use them. I used a bit over 2 hours 
for the task, big part of which was fixing little bugs and doing input "sanititazion". 

Overall I found the task to be very fun, even though at first it seemed a bit daunting, considering I have never really done anything
similar before. I think I performed fairly well when taking everything into consideration.
